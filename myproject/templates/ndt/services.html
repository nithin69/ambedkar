<p>Radiography Testing is a NDT Process, By using radiant energy in the form of neutrons, X-rays (or) Gamma rays for Non Destructive examination of an opaque objects in order To produce a graphical record on sensitized films which indicates the comparative soundness of the obeject being tested. The process in which a material/specimen is exposed to radiation (X-RAYS OR Gamma Rays) and the discontinuity is recorded on the film and further film is developed in a darkroom to get the permanent record of the discontinuity. The indication on a radiograph film is just an area of “with difference in Density” Hence darker area (or) a lighter area forms the indication on the radiograph. The appearance of the indication on the radiograph is due to “DIFFERENTIAL ABSORPTION” Different materials are having different rate of absorption when it falls on the material. Radiography technique requires for the area where radiography has to be done to be evacuated during the testing period. This is done with Ir-192 or Se-75 sources and X-ray machines.</p>

<p>Principle of Radiographic Testing is ““DIFFERENTIAL ABSORPTION of PENETRATING RADIATION”</p>

<p>In Ultrasonic testing we can find the flaws through using sound waves, very short ultrasonic pulse-waves with center frequencies ranging from 0.1-15 MHz and occasionally up to 50 MHz are launched into materials to detect internal flaws or to characterize materials. …Productivity and quality are the buzz words in quality control and in-service inspection and ultrasonic Non-Destructive testing (NDT) is certainly the answer. Ultrasonic technology is used to measure wall thickness, detect hidden cracks and other anomalies affecting structural integrity.

<div class="panel-body">
<p>Magnetic particle testing is a widely established non destructive method for the detection of surface breaking flaws as well as sub-surface flaws with depths of 2-3mm. The method is accomplished by inducing a magnetic field in ferromagnetic materials. The surface is coated with a white contrast paint and over this paint iron particles suspended in liquid are applied. Surface and near surface flaws produce magnetic poles and iron particles are attracted and concentrated, producing a visible indication of the defects on the surface of the material. The length of an indication can be accurately determined, but the depth cannot be determined with this method.</p></div>

<div class="panel-body">
<p>Liquid penetrant testing is a traditional non-destructive method for inspection of surface breaking flaws such as cracks and porosity in test objects with non-porous surfaces. The tested surface is cleaned and coated with a penetrant solution either a visible or fluorescent dye that is drawn into the discontinuity by capillary action. The excess solution is removed from the surface, but the penetrant remains in the surface breaking flaws. A white developer is then applied to draw the penetrant out of the defects and shows a contrast image. After the evaluation of the indications the surface is cleaned.</p>
<br><p>Liquid penetrant testing can be used on relatively dirty surfaces, but the sensitivity is decreased, but a fluorescent penetrant can also be used that gives increased sensitivity. The length of an indication can be accurately determined, but the depth cannot be determined with this method.</p>

This method is non destructive and fast, allows the analysis of many elements simultaneously, and is applied for a range of concentrations.

</p><br><p>Analyzers rapidly determine those elements present in the sample and their relative concentrations – in other words, the elemental chemistry of the sample. For samples with known ranges of chemical composition, such as common grades of metal alloys, the analyzer also identifies most sample types by name, typically in seconds.</p></div>

<p>
Visual testing is the observation of a test object or specimen, either directly with the eyes, or indirectly by utilizing optical instruments, by an inspector or technician to evaluate the presence of surface anomalies, or an object’s conformance to a specification.
<br>Visual examination is the most basic non-destructive testing method, which precedes and is used in conjunction with any others NDT method. Visual inspection is a method that ranges from simply looking at a part to see if surface imperfections or defects are present and visible, to using video inspection systems and small diameter bore scopes to reach into areas with limited access.
</p><br><p>The portable video scopes combine light weight with reliability and ease of use with advanced features to allow inspections in various positions and conditions.

<p>
UTG is a method of performing non-destructive measurement (gauging) of the local thickness of a solid element (typically made of metal, if using ultrasound testing for industrial purposes) basing on the time taken by the ultrasound wave to return to the surface. This type of measurement is typically performed with an ultrasonic thickness gauge.

<div class="panel-body">
<p>Mobile hardness testing is on the advance, as it represents a quick, economical and dependable way to measure hardness. Hardness testing is understood as the resistance of a material against the vertical penetration of a body by a material of greater hardness. The hardness of a material is determined by forcing an indenter into the surface of the material under load and then measuring the indentation size, or the backward bounce speed and distance of the plunger applied. There are three principal standard test methods for expressing the relationship between hardness and the size of the impression, these being Brinell, Vickers, and Rockwell.</p></div>
